#g-core

g-core is a super minimalist scaffolding for writing a REST API in Go.

## Why should you care?

If you're not entirely sold on an entire Go framework, you're probably the type of person that wants to pick and choose your own middleware depending on what your project calls for.  This scaffolding is as unopinionated as it can be in terms of middleware.

This is a starting point for those who don't want to write scaffolding over and over again, but also want the full flexibility of picking their own middleware.

## User model/controller

You'll note that included is a user model + controller.  This is simply to express a model / controller pattern that I have found works very well.

## Getting started

### Setting up

Before you start, make sure you have [gom](https://github.com/mattn/gom) installed.

You will also need to set an environment variable named `PORT` to the port you would like gcore to run on.

After that, run these commands:

```sh
go get github.com/carrot/gcore
cd "$GOPATH/src/github.com/carrot/gcore/"
gom install
gom build
```

Now gcore should be ready to run, so just run:

```sh
./gcore
```

Head over to `http://localhost:$PORT/users/1` in a browser.  If you get a 200 response, you're all set up.

### Custom package name

Of course you don't want to use gcore as your project name, so we're going to have to do a little tweaking.

Run this command in the gcore directory:

```sh
grep -RI 'github.com/carrot/gcore' --exclude="README.md" .
```

Now go and replace all of the occurances of `github.com/carrot/gcore` with whatever your package name will be.

After you've finished that, you can actually move the library to the appropriate place in your gopath to match up with your new package.

You'll probably want to delete the README + git related files so you can start of fresh.
